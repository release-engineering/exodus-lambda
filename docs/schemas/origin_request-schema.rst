origin_request Schemas
=================

The following schemas are required of AWS S3 bucket objects and DynamoDB table
items for use with the origin_request AWS Lambda function.

S3 Bucket Schema
----------------

Objects should be stored in the origin S3 bucket using a sha256 checksum as
their key.

DynamoDB Table Schema
---------------------

DynamoDB table items must possess the following keys and attributes.

Additional attributes are supported by the no-SQL model and may be used as
needed.

Keys

- web_uri
    (Primary)

    A logical path to the desired content, excluding the hostname,
    i.e., "/content/place/somepic.png".

    Only content with a from_date sooner than or equal to the current date and
    time may be retrieved from the origin.
