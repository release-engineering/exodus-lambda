Architecture
============


Overview
--------

This diagram shows the relationship between all major components used
in the delivery of content via the CDN.

.. graphviz:: arch.gv

- Numbered connections represent the sequence of events when the CDN processes
  a request.
- For clarity, SHA256 checksums have been truncated (as in
  ``8e7750e50734f...``). In reality, the system stores complete checksums.
- The CloudFront CDN shown in the above diagram may itself be hosted behind
  another CDN, so client requests may pass through additional layers not
  expressed here.


Components
----------

client
    A client requesting data from the CDN.

    This could be ``dnf``, ``yum``, Satellite, ``curl``, a web browser, etc.

CloudFront CDN
    The `Amazon CloudFront`_ content delivery network.

controller
    An abstract component representing the built-in behaviors of CloudFront,
    such as:

    - basic HTTP request handling
    - serving responses from cache
    - invoking Lambda functions
    - delegating requests to S3

    ...and so on.

DynamoDB
    `Amazon DynamoDB`_ NoSQL database service.

    The CDN uses a single DynamoDB table which primarily contains mappings
    between URIs and S3 object keys.

    For more information about the data contained here, see :ref:`schema_ref`.

S3
    `Amazon S3`_, Simple Storage Service.

    The CDN uses S3 to store the binary objects retrievable by clients.
    A single bucket is used, configured as the origin of the CloudFront CDN.

    One object corresponds to one file which can be downloaded from the CDN;
    this includes files considered to be content (such as RPMs) and files
    considered to be metadata (such as yum repo metadata files).

    Each object's key is its own SHA256 checksum, ensuring that content
    accessible via many paths on the CDN need only be stored once.

    S3 metadata is used in some cases to customize the response behavior of
    each object; for example, metadata is used to adjust ``Content-Type``
    headers in responses. Publishing tools are responsible for setting this
    metadata accurately.

    For more information about the data contained here, see :ref:`schema_ref`.

exodus-lambda
    A project including Python-based implementations of `Lambda@Edge`_
    functions for the CDN.

    You are currently reading the documentation of this project.

origin_request
    A `Lambda@Edge`_ function connected to "origin request" events in
    CloudFront.

    This function is primarily responsible for translating the path given in
    the client's request into an S3 object key via a DynamoDB query.  Assuming
    the client has requested existing content, this Lambda function will
    rewrite the request's URI into a valid S3 object key before returning the
    request to the controller. The function itself does not request data from
    S3, nor generate a response directly.

    For more information about this function's behavior, see
    :ref:`function_ref`.

origin_response
    A `Lambda@Edge`_ function connected to "origin response" events in
    CloudFront.

    This function is primarily responsible for tweaking certain response
    headers before allowing CloudFront to serve the response to clients. For
    example, caching behavior is influenced by setting a Cache-Control header
    for certain responses.

    For more information about this function's behavior, see
    :ref:`function_ref`.

`exodus-gw`_
    A microservice dedicated to writing data onto the CDN, this component
    exposes an HTTP API for use by publishing tools, and enforces certain
    policies on published content.

    It is the only component permitted to perform writes on DynamoDB and S3
    (hence, the "exodus gateway").

`exodus-rsync`_
    A drop-in replacement for the ``rsync`` command. This command has
    an interface which is partially compatible with ``rsync``, but it
    performs publishes via API calls to ``exodus-gw`` rather than using
    the rsync protocol.

    exodus-rsync is not fully rsync-compatible; it is engineered to support
    specific known publishing tools designed for rsync.

publishing tools (rsync)
    Represents tools used by Red Hat to publish content onto the CDN which
    are designed to use rsync and are mostly unaware of the Exodus CDN
    architecture. These tools are made to publish to Exodus CDN by replacing
    the ``rsync`` command with ``exodus-rsync``.

    RHSM Pulp is an example of a publishing tool using rsync.

publishing tools (exodus)
    Represents tools used by Red Hat to publish content onto the CDN which
    are explicitly designed for Exodus CDN.

    These tools don't need to use the ``exodus-rsync`` compatibility layer,
    and so may have improved performance or an extended feature set when
    compared with tools using rsync.
